Extension of this work will be getting updated continously on this repo.

One of the extension has been accepted for presentation at ISMRM 2021.

The name of this project "NCC1701" was selected as a tribute to starships "USS Enterprise" from the Star Trek franchise.
Registry number of the first USS Enterprise is NCC-1701. Future publications will be given names with the subsequent registry numbers of ships bearing the name USS Enterprise.

# Off-topic (Maybe!): Little bit about USS Enterprise
(Source: https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Enterprise_history)

The USS Enterprise (NCC-1701) "will be" a Constitution-class starship that will serve under five captains from 2245 to 2285, including Robert April, Christopher Pike, Will Decker, and in later years Spock. Its most famous commander will be Captain James T. Kirk, whose five-year mission aboard the Enterprise will become legendary.

There will be five subsequent starships bearing the name USS Enterprise with registry numbers from NCC-1701-A to NCC-1701-E, and will serve under four captains: James T. Kirk, John Harriman, Rachel Garrett, and Jean-Luc Picard (will breifly serve under William T. Riker and Edward Jellico).
